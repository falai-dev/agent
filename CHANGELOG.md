# Changelog

All notable changes to `@falai/agent` will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.2]

### Fixed

- **Sticky route switching**: Route switching now uses a score margin strategy instead of a loose absolute threshold. The agent stays on the current route unless an alternative scores higher by a configurable margin (`routeSwitchMargin`, default: 15). This prevents unnecessary route flip-flopping on marginal score differences.

- **Dead routing code removal**: Removed `decideRouteFromScores`, `switchThreshold`, `maxCandidates`, `allowRouteSwitch`, and `RoutingDecisionWithRoute` — all were configured but never wired into the actual routing flow.

- **Documentation dead links**: Fixed all broken internal links across docs (wrong relative paths to `examples/`, references to non-existent files like `AGENT.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `PROVIDERS.md`, `PERSISTENCE.md`, `ADAPTERS.md`, `tool-execution.md`, and missing example files).

### Added

- **`routeSwitchMargin` option**: New `AgentOptions` property to configure how much higher an alternative route must score before the agent switches away from the current route. Accepts values 0-100 (default: 15).

## [1.0.1]

### Fixed

- **Step `requires` enforcement**: Steps with `requires` fields that reference uncollected data now correctly block advancement. The agent stays at the current step instead of skipping ahead, and emits a console warning identifying the missing fields and the step that cannot proceed. This applies to both streaming and non-streaming response paths.

- **Dynamic schema generation from `collect` fields**: When no agent-level `schema` is provided, the response schema and data collection prompts are now dynamically generated from the step's `collect` fields (defaulting to `type: "string"` per field). Previously, collect fields were silently ignored if no schema was defined, resulting in no structured extraction.

### Added

- **Agent-level `rules` and `prohibitions`**: `AgentOptions` now accepts `rules` and `prohibitions` arrays (same `Template` type used by routes). These are merged with route-level rules/prohibitions and included in all prompt compositions — single-step, batch, and streaming. See [Agent Rules & Prohibitions](docs/core/agent/rules-and-prohibitions.md) for details.

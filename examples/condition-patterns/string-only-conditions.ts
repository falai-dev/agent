/**
 * String-Only Conditions Example
 * 
 * This example demonstrates using string-only conditions for AI context-driven routing.
 * String conditions are perfect when you want the AI to make routing decisions based
 * on natural language understanding rather than programmatic logic.
 * 
 * Key concepts:
 * - String conditions provide AI context only
 * - No programmatic evaluation - pure AI decision making
 * - Perfect for natural language routing scenarios
 * - Ideal for conversational flows where intent matters more than data

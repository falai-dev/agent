# Migration Guides

This directory contains migration guides for major changes and updates to the `@falai/agent` framework.

## Available Migration Guides

### [Multi-Step Execution Migration Guide](./multi-step-execution.md)

**v1.0.0 - Major Release** - Guide for understanding and migrating to multi-step batch execution.

**Breaking Changes:**
- � **History API Simplified**: `createMessageEvent`/`EventSource` replaced with `userMessage`/`assistantMessage`
- 📝 **StepOptions**: `instructions` property renamed to `prompt`

**What's New:**
- 🚀 **Multi-Step Batching**: Multiple steps execute in a single LLM call
- ⚡ **Reduced LLM Costs**: Fewer calls for the same outcome
- 🎯 **Better UX**: Less back-and-forth in conversations
- 📊 **New Response Fields**: `executedSteps`, `stoppedReason`, `error`

**Key Changes:**
- Steps batch together when data requirements are satisfied
- Pre-extraction happens before batch determination
- Hook execution order: all prepare → LLM → all finalize
- SkipIf conditions affect batch determination

**Migration Status:**
- ⚠️ **Breaking Changes**: History API and StepOptions.instructions
- ⚠️ **Behavioral Change**: Execution semantics differ
- ✅ **Gradual Migration**: Review hooks and tests

### [ResponseModal Refactor Migration Guide](./response-modal-refactor.md)

**Latest Update** - Comprehensive guide for migrating to the new ResponseModal architecture.

**What's New:**
- 🚀 **Modern Streaming API**: Simple `agent.stream('message')` interface
- 🏗️ **Better Architecture**: Separated response logic from Agent class
- 🔄 **Full Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work
- ⚡ **Performance Improvements**: Unified response logic and optimizations

**Key Benefits:**
- Automatic session management with `stream()` API
- Simplified streaming interface compared to `respondStream()`
- Better error handling with `ResponseGenerationError`
- Improved maintainability and testability

**Migration Status:**
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes
- ✅ **Gradual Migration**: Adopt new APIs at your own pace
- ✅ **Production Ready**: New APIs are fully tested and stable

## Migration Philosophy

Our migration approach prioritizes:

1. **🔄 Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
2. **📈 Gradual Adoption**: New features can be adopted incrementally
3. **📚 Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides with examples
4. **🛠️ Developer Experience**: Improved APIs that are easier to use
5. **⚡ Performance**: Better performance without breaking existing functionality

## Getting Help

- **📖 Documentation**: Each migration guide includes detailed examples and comparisons
- **💡 Examples**: Check the [examples directory](../../../examples/) for updated code samples
- **🐛 Issues**: Report migration issues on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/falai-dev/agent/issues)
- **💬 Discussions**: Ask questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/falai-dev/agent/discussions)

## Best Practices

### Before Migrating

1. **Read the migration guide** thoroughly
2. **Test in development** before applying to production
3. **Review examples** to understand new patterns
4. **Check for breaking changes** (though we avoid them when possible)

### During Migration

1. **Migrate gradually** - don't change everything at once
2. **Keep existing code working** while adopting new APIs
3. **Test thoroughly** after each migration step
4. **Monitor performance** to ensure improvements

### After Migration

1. **Update documentation** to reflect new patterns
2. **Train team members** on new APIs and best practices
3. **Monitor for issues** and report any problems
4. **Share feedback** to help improve future migrations

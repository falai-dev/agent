## What is a Route?

A **Route** (also called a "Journey") represents a specific conversational flow in your agent. Think of it as a state machine that guides the conversation through a series of steps to accomplish a specific goal.

```typescript
// Example: A route for booking flights
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",
  description: "Help user book a flight",
  conditions: ["User wants to book a flight"],
});
```

**Key Concepts:**

- Each route has a **goal** (e.g., "book a flight", "answer FAQ", "collect feedback")
- Routes contain **states** that represent conversation steps
- Routes can extract and track **typed data** throughout the conversation
- Routes have their own **rules**, **prohibitions**, and **guidelines**

---

## Creating Routes

### Basic Route

```typescript
interface FlightData {
  destination: string;
  departureDate: string;
  passengers: number;
}

const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",
  description: "Help user book a flight",
  conditions: [
    "User wants to book a flight",
    "User mentions flying or traveling",
  ],
});
```

### Route with Data Extraction Schema

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",
  description: "Help user book a flight",
  conditions: ["User wants to book a flight"],

  // Define what data to extract
  extractionSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      destination: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Where the user wants to fly",
      },
      departureDate: {
        type: "string",
        description: "When they want to depart",
      },
      passengers: {
        type: "number",
        minimum: 1,
        maximum: 9,
      },
    },
    required: ["destination", "departureDate", "passengers"],
  },
});
```

### Route with Rules and Prohibitions

```typescript
const paymentRoute = agent.createRoute({
  title: "Process Payment",
  conditions: ["User wants to make a payment"],

  // Absolute rules the agent MUST follow
  rules: [
    "Always confirm the payment amount before processing",
    "Verify payment method is supported",
    "Provide a receipt after successful payment",
  ],

  // Things the agent must NEVER do
  prohibitions: [
    "Never store credit card numbers",
    "Never process payments without explicit confirmation",
    "Never share payment details with third parties",
  ],
});
```

---

## Initial State Configuration

Every route starts with an initial state. You can now configure it in two ways:

### Option 1: Configure at Route Creation

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",

  // Configure the initial state
  initialState: {
    id: "welcome_state",
    chatState:
      "Welcome! I'll help you book a flight. Where would you like to go?",
    gather: ["destination"],
    skipIf: (extracted) => !!extracted.destination,
  },

  extractionSchema: {
    // ... schema definition
  },
});
```

### Option 2: Configure After Route Creation

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",
  // ... other options
});

// Configure initial state later
bookingRoute.initialState.configure({
  description: "Welcome! Let's book your flight",
  gatherFields: ["destination"],
  skipIf: (extracted) => !!extracted.destination,
});
```

### Initial State Options

```typescript
initialState: {
  // Custom ID for the initial state
  id?: string;

  // Description/prompt for the initial state
  chatState?: string;

  // Fields to extract in this state
  gather?: string[];

  // Skip this state if condition is met
  skipIf?: (extracted: Partial<TExtracted>) => boolean;

  // Prerequisites that must be metw
  requiredData?: string[];
}
```

---

## End State Configuration

Every route ends when it reaches `END_STATE`. You can configure what happens at route completion:

### Configure End State at Route Creation

```typescript
import { END_STATE } from "@falai/agent";

const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",

  // Configure what happens when route completes
  endState: {
    // Custom completion message
    chatState: "Confirm the booking details and thank the user warmly!",

    // Optional: Execute final actions (like sending confirmation emails)
    toolState: sendConfirmationEmail,

    // Optional: Gather final data before completing
    gather: ["finalConfirmation"],

    // Optional: Require certain data to be present
    requiredData: ["destination", "departureDate"],

    // Optional: Custom state ID
    id: "booking_complete",
  },

  extractionSchema: {
    // ... schema definition
  },
});

// Then just transition to END_STATE
lastState.transitionTo({
  state: END_STATE,
});
```

### Per-Transition Override

You can also override the endState configuration for specific transitions:

```typescript
// Use route-level endState
lastState.transitionTo({
  state: END_STATE,
});

// OR override with custom chatState for this specific transition
lastState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Special completion message for this path!",
  state: END_STATE,
});
```

### End State Options

```typescript
endState: {
  // Completion message instruction (RECOMMENDED)
  chatState?: string;

  // Execute final tools/actions before completion
  toolState?: ToolRef;

  // Gather final data at completion
  gather?: string[];

  // Require specific data to be present
  requiredData?: string[];

  // Custom state ID for debugging
  id?: string;
}
```

### Default Behavior

If you don't configure `endState`, a smart default is used:

```typescript
// Default endState behavior:
{
  chatState: "Summarize what was accomplished and confirm completion based on the conversation history and collected data"
}
```

### End State with Tools

Execute final actions when route completes:

```typescript
import { defineTool, END_STATE } from "@falai/agent";

const sendConfirmation = defineTool(
  "send_confirmation",
  async ({ extracted }) => {
    await emailService.send({
      to: extracted.email,
      subject: "Booking Confirmed",
      body: `Your flight to ${extracted.destination} is confirmed!`,
    });
    return { data: "Confirmation sent" };
  }
);

const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute({
  title: "Book Flight",

  endState: {
    toolState: sendConfirmation,  // Executes when route completes
    chatState: "Your booking is complete! Confirmation email sent.",
  },
});
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ `endState` is configured once at the route level (DRY principle)
- ‚úÖ Can be overridden per-transition if needed
- ‚úÖ Supports full state capabilities: `chatState`, `toolState`, `gather`, `requiredData`
- ‚úÖ Falls back to smart default if not configured

---

## Data Extraction

### Defining Extraction Schema

The extraction schema defines what data your route will collect:

```typescript
const onboardingRoute = agent.createRoute<OnboardingData>({
  title: "User Onboarding",

  extractionSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      firstName: { type: "string" },
      lastName: { type: "string" },
      email: { type: "string", format: "email" },
      company: { type: "string" },
      role: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ["developer", "designer", "manager", "other"],
      },
    },
    required: ["firstName", "lastName", "email"],
  },
});
```

### Getting Extracted Data

```typescript
// Get extracted data from the route
const extracted = bookingRoute.getExtractedData(session);

console.log(extracted);
// { destination: "Paris", departureDate: "2025-06-15", passengers: 2 }

// Only returns data if session is in this route
const otherRouteData = otherRoute.getExtractedData(session);
// {} - empty if session is in a different route
```

### Pre-populating Data

You can pre-populate data when entering a route:

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",

  // Pre-fill known information
  initialData: {
    destination: "Paris", // User mentioned this earlier
    passengers: 1, // Default value
  },

  extractionSchema: {
    // ... schema
  },
});

// States with skipIf will automatically bypass if data exists
```

---

## Sequential Steps

For simple linear flows, use the `steps` option:

```typescript
const feedbackRoute = agent.createRoute({
  title: "Collect Feedback",

  steps: [
    {
      id: "ask_rating",
      chatState: "How would you rate your experience? (1-5 stars)",
      gather: ["rating"],
    },
    {
      id: "ask_liked",
      chatState: "What did you like most?",
      gather: ["likedMost"],
    },
    {
      id: "ask_improve",
      chatState: "What could we improve?",
      gather: ["improvements"],
    },
    {
      id: "thank_you",
      chatState: "Thank you for your feedback! üôè",
    },
  ],
});

// Automatically chains: initialState ‚Üí ask_rating ‚Üí ask_liked ‚Üí ask_improve ‚Üí thank_you ‚Üí END_STATE
```

**When to use steps vs manual chaining:**

- ‚úÖ Use `steps` for: Linear flows, simple wizards, sequential data collection
- ‚úÖ Use manual chaining for: Branching logic, conditional flows, complex state machines

---

## Route Properties

### Accessing Route Properties

```typescript
const route = agent.createRoute({ ... });

// Route identification
console.log(route.id);          // "route_book_flight_abc123"
console.log(route.title);       // "Book Flight"
console.log(route.description); // "Help user book a flight"

// Activation conditions
console.log(route.conditions);  // ["User wants to book a flight"]

// Rules and guidelines
console.log(route.getRules());        // ["Always confirm...", ...]
console.log(route.getProhibitions()); // ["Never store...", ...]
console.log(route.getGuidelines());   // [{ condition: "...", action: "..." }]

// Domain restrictions
console.log(route.getDomains());      // ["payment", "booking"] or undefined
```

### Route Reference

```typescript
const routeRef = route.getRef();
console.log(routeRef); // { id: "route_book_flight_abc123" }

// Use reference to jump to specific routes
state.transitionTo({ state: routeRef });
```

### Route Structure

```typescript
// Get all states in the route
const states = route.getAllStates();
console.log(states); // [State, State, State, ...]

// Get specific state by ID
const state = route.getState("ask_destination");

// Describe route structure
console.log(route.describe());
// Output:
// Route: Book Flight
// ID: route_book_flight_abc123
// Description: Help user book a flight
// Conditions: User wants to book a flight
//
// States:
//   - initial_state: Initial state
//     -> ask_destination
//   - ask_destination: Ask where they want to fly
//     -> ask_dates
//   ...
```

---

## Route Security

### Domain Scoping

Restrict which tools/domains a route can access:

```typescript
// Define domains
agent.addDomain("payment", {
  processPayment: async (amount: number) => {
    /* ... */
  },
  refund: async (transactionId: string) => {
    /* ... */
  },
});

agent.addDomain("booking", {
  searchFlights: async (dest: string) => {
    /* ... */
  },
  createReservation: async (data: any) => {
    /* ... */
  },
});

agent.addDomain("database", {
  saveUser: async (user: any) => {
    /* ... */
  },
  deleteUser: async (userId: string) => {
    /* ... */
  },
});

// Payment route: only access payment tools
const paymentRoute = agent.createRoute({
  title: "Process Payment",
  domains: ["payment"], // ONLY payment domain
});

// Booking route: access booking AND payment
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute({
  title: "Book Flight",
  domains: ["booking", "payment"], // Both domains
});

// Admin route: access everything
const adminRoute = agent.createRoute({
  title: "Admin Actions",
  // domains: undefined = all domains allowed
});
```

**Security Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental tool execution in wrong context
- ‚úÖ Reduces attack surface for each route
- ‚úÖ Makes permissions explicit and auditable

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Branching Logic

```typescript
const supportRoute = agent.createRoute<SupportData>({
  title: "Customer Support",
});

// Ask issue type
const askIssueType = supportRoute.initialState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "What type of issue are you experiencing?",
  gather: ["issueType"],
});

// Branch 1: Technical issues
const technicalFlow = askIssueType.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Let me help with your technical issue...",
  condition: "Issue type is technical",
});

// Branch 2: Billing issues
const billingFlow = askIssueType.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Let me help with your billing issue...",
  condition: "Issue type is billing",
});

// Branch 3: General inquiries
const generalFlow = askIssueType.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Let me help with your inquiry...",
  condition: "Issue type is general",
});
```

### Pattern 2: Conditional Skip States

```typescript
const checkoutRoute = agent.createRoute<CheckoutData>({
  title: "Checkout",
  extractionSchema: {
    properties: {
      hasAccount: { type: "boolean" },
      email: { type: "string" },
      shippingAddress: { type: "object" },
      billingAddress: { type: "object" },
    },
  },
});

// Skip login if user already has account
const login = checkoutRoute.initialState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Please log in or continue as guest",
  gather: ["hasAccount", "email"],
  skipIf: (extracted) => extracted.hasAccount === true,
});

// Skip billing address if same as shipping
const shippingAddress = login.transitionTo({
  chatState: "What's your shipping address?",
  gather: ["shippingAddress"],
});

const billingAddress = shippingAddress.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Is your billing address the same as shipping?",
  gather: ["billingAddress"],
  skipIf: (extracted) => extracted.billingAddress !== undefined,
});
```

### Pattern 3: Route-Specific Guidelines

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute({
  title: "Book Flight",
});

// Add guidelines specific to this route
bookingRoute.createGuideline({
  condition: "User asks about cancellation policy",
  action: "Explain that cancellations must be made 24 hours in advance",
  tags: ["policy"],
});

bookingRoute.createGuideline({
  condition: "User provides invalid date",
  action: "Politely ask for a valid future date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
  tags: ["validation"],
});
```

### Pattern 4: Tool Integration in Routes

```typescript
import { defineTool } from "@falai/agent";

const searchFlights = defineTool<MyContext, [], FlightResults>(
  "search_flights",
  async ({ context, extracted }) => {
    const flights = await api.searchFlights({
      destination: extracted.destination,
      date: extracted.departureDate,
    });

    return {
      data: flights,
      contextUpdate: { availableFlights: flights },
    };
  }
);

const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<FlightData>({
  title: "Book Flight",
  domains: ["booking"], // Ensure tool is in this domain
});

// Gather data
const gatherDetails = bookingRoute.initialState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Where and when would you like to fly?",
  gather: ["destination", "departureDate", "passengers"],
});

// Execute tool
const searchState = gatherDetails.transitionTo({
  toolState: searchFlights,
  requiredData: ["destination", "departureDate", "passengers"],
});

// Present results
const presentFlights = searchState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Here are available flights based on your search",
});
```

---

## Route Completion

When a route reaches its final state and transitions to `END_STATE`, the agent returns `isRouteComplete: true` to signal that all required data has been collected.

### Ending a Route

Use the `END_STATE` symbol to mark the end of a route:

```typescript
import { END_STATE } from "@falai/agent";

const onboardingRoute = agent.createRoute<OnboardingData>({
  title: "User Onboarding",
  extractionSchema: ONBOARDING_SCHEMA,
});

const askName = onboardingRoute.initialState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "What's your name?",
  gather: ["name"],
});

const askEmail = askName.transitionTo({
  chatState: "What's your email?",
  gather: ["email"],
});

const thankYou = askEmail.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Thank you! Your profile is complete.",
});

// End the route
thankYou.transitionTo({ state: END_STATE });
```

### Handling Completion

There are **two ways** to check if a route has completed:

#### Method 1: Using `isRouteComplete` (Recommended)

```typescript
const response = await agent.respond({
  history,
  session,
});

if (response.isRouteComplete) {
  // ‚úÖ Route is complete! All data has been collected

  // Get the collected data
  const data = agent.getExtractedData(response.session!);
  console.log("Collected data:", data);

  // Process the data
  await saveToDatabase(data);
  await sendConfirmationEmail(data.email);

  // Show custom completion message
  return "Thank you! Your information has been saved.";
} else {
  // ‚è≥ Route still in progress
  return response.message;
}
```

#### Method 2: Using `END_STATE_ID` Constant

For users who prefer a symbol-based pattern consistent with building routes:

```typescript
import { END_STATE_ID } from "@falai/agent";

const response = await agent.respond({
  history,
  session,
});

if (response.session?.currentState?.id === END_STATE_ID) {
  // ‚úÖ Route completed - currentState is now END_STATE
  const data = agent.getExtractedData(response.session!);
  await handleCompletion(data);
  return "Complete!";
}

return response.message;
```

**Which method should you use?**

- ‚úÖ **Use `isRouteComplete`** for simplicity and clarity
- ‚úÖ **Use `END_STATE_ID`** if you want consistency with how you build routes (`END_STATE` symbol)

---

## Route Transitions with `onComplete`

**NEW:** You can now automatically transition to another route when a route completes using the `onComplete` option. This is perfect for chaining workflows like:

- üìã Post-booking feedback collection
- üéÅ Upsell offers after purchase
- üìä Satisfaction surveys after support
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Error recovery flows

### Simple String Transition

The simplest form - just specify the target route ID or title:

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<BookingData>({
  title: "Book Hotel",
  conditions: ["User wants to book a hotel"],
  extractionSchema: BOOKING_SCHEMA,
  // Automatically transition to feedback when booking completes
  onComplete: "Collect Feedback",
});

const feedbackRoute = agent.createRoute<FeedbackData>({
  title: "Collect Feedback",
  conditions: ["Collect user feedback"],
  extractionSchema: FEEDBACK_SCHEMA,
});
```

### With AI-Evaluated Condition

Add an optional condition that the AI evaluates to determine if transition should happen:

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<BookingData>({
  title: "Book Hotel",
  extractionSchema: BOOKING_SCHEMA,
  onComplete: {
    transitionTo: "Collect Feedback",
    condition: "if booking was successful", // AI evaluates this
  },
});
```

### Dynamic Function-Based Transition

Use a function for complex logic based on extracted data or context:

```typescript
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<BookingData>({
  title: "Book Hotel",
  extractionSchema: BOOKING_SCHEMA,
  // Function receives session and context
  onComplete: (session, context) => {
    // Conditional logic based on extracted data
    if (session.extracted?.guests && session.extracted.guests > 5) {
      return "VIP Feedback"; // Large groups get VIP treatment
    }
    if (session.extracted?.bookingFailed) {
      return "Error Recovery"; // Handle failures gracefully
    }
    return "Collect Feedback"; // Standard feedback flow
  },
});
```

Function can also return a config object:

```typescript
onComplete: (session) => ({
  transitionTo: "Collect Feedback",
  condition: session.extracted?.vip ? "if user is satisfied" : undefined,
})
```

### How It Works

1. **Route completes** ‚Üí reaches `END_STATE`
2. **Agent evaluates** `onComplete` handler
3. **Sets pending transition** in session state
4. **Next `respond()` call** ‚Üí automatically transitions to target route
5. **User sees seamless flow** ‚Üí no interruption in conversation

```typescript
// User books hotel
const response1 = await agent.respond({ history, session });
console.log(response1.isRouteComplete); // true
console.log(response1.session?.pendingTransition); // { targetRouteId: "...", reason: "route_complete" }

// Next message automatically transitions to feedback route
history.push(createMessageEvent(EventSource.CUSTOMER, "User", "Yes!"));
const response2 = await agent.respond({ history, session: response1.session });
console.log(response2.session?.currentRoute?.title); // "Collect Feedback"
```

### Manual Transition Control

For more control, use `agent.transitionToRoute()` to manually set the transition:

```typescript
const response = await agent.respond({ history, session });

if (response.isRouteComplete && shouldCollectFeedback) {
  // Manually trigger transition instead of onComplete
  const updatedSession = agent.transitionToRoute(
    "Collect Feedback",
    response.session
  );

  // Next respond() will transition automatically
  const nextResponse = await agent.respond({
    history,
    session: updatedSession,
  });
}
```

### Complete Example

```typescript
interface BookingData {
  hotelName: string;
  date: string;
  guests: number;
}

interface FeedbackData {
  rating: number;
  comments?: string;
}

// Booking route with automatic transition to feedback
const bookingRoute = agent.createRoute<BookingData>({
  title: "Book Hotel",
  conditions: ["User wants to book a hotel"],
  extractionSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      hotelName: { type: "string" },
      date: { type: "string" },
      guests: { type: "number" },
    },
    required: ["hotelName", "date", "guests"],
  },
  onComplete: "Collect Feedback",
});

const askHotel = bookingRoute.initialState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Ask which hotel",
  gather: ["hotelName"],
  skipIf: (e) => !!e.hotelName,
});

const askDate = askHotel.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Ask for date",
  gather: ["date"],
  skipIf: (e) => !!e.date,
});

const askGuests = askDate.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Ask for guests",
  gather: ["guests"],
  skipIf: (e) => !!e.guests,
});

askGuests.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Confirm booking",
  state: END_STATE,
});

// Feedback route
const feedbackRoute = agent.createRoute<FeedbackData>({
  title: "Collect Feedback",
  conditions: ["Collect user feedback"],
  extractionSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      rating: { type: "number" },
      comments: { type: "string" },
    },
    required: ["rating"],
  },
});

const askRating = feedbackRoute.initialState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Ask for rating 1-5",
  gather: ["rating"],
});

askRating.transitionTo({
  chatState: "Thank user",
  state: END_STATE,
});

// Usage - seamless transition from booking to feedback
let session;
const response1 = await agent.respond({ history, session });
// Booking complete, pending transition set

history.push(createMessageEvent(EventSource.CUSTOMER, "User", "Yes!"));
const response2 = await agent.respond({ history, session: response1.session });
// Now in feedback route automatically
```

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Seamless user experience** - No awkward pauses between flows
‚úÖ **Predictable behavior** - Transitions defined at design time
‚úÖ **Flexible** - Simple strings, conditions, or complex functions
‚úÖ **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript inference for extracted data
‚úÖ **Non-breaking** - Existing routes without `onComplete` work as before

See [examples/route-transitions.ts](../examples/route-transitions.ts) for a complete working example.

### Immediate Completion

Routes can complete **immediately** if all states are skipped due to `skipIf` conditions. This is useful when:

- Resuming a partially completed route
- Pre-filling data from an existing session
- User provides all information upfront

```typescript
const onboardingRoute = agent.createRoute<OnboardingData>({
  title: "User Onboarding",
  extractionSchema: ONBOARDING_SCHEMA,
  initialData: existingUserData, // Pre-fill with existing data
});

const askName = onboardingRoute.initialState.transitionTo({
  chatState: "What's your name?",
  gather: ["name"],
  skipIf: (data) => !!data.name, // Skip if name exists
});

const askEmail = askName.transitionTo({
  chatState: "What's your email?",
  gather: ["email"],
  skipIf: (data) => !!data.email, // Skip if email exists
});

const complete = askEmail.transitionTo({
  chatState: "All done!",
});

complete.transitionTo({ state: END_STATE });

// In your handler:
const response = await agent.respond({ history, session });

if (response.isRouteComplete) {
  // If existingUserData had all fields, route completes immediately!
  // The routing engine recursively skips all states and reaches END_STATE
  console.log("Profile already complete!");
}
```

### Important Notes

- **`isRouteComplete: true`** indicates the route has reached `END_STATE`
- **`currentState.id`** is set to `END_STATE_ID` when the route completes
- **`response.message`** will be empty (`""`) when route is complete
- **The routing engine** recursively traverses skipped states to detect completion
- **You can check either** `isRouteComplete` or `currentState.id === END_STATE_ID`
- **Session state** still contains all the collected data via `agent.getExtractedData()`
- **The route** (`currentRoute.id`) remains the completed route (e.g., "onboarding"), not END_STATE

### With Streaming

```typescript
for await (const chunk of agent.respondStream({ history, session })) {
  if (chunk.delta) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.delta);
  }

  if (chunk.done && chunk.isRouteComplete) {
    console.log("\nüéâ Route completed!");
    const data = agent.getExtractedData(chunk.session!);
    await processCompletedData(data);
  }
}
```

- **Use descriptive titles and descriptions** - Makes routing more accurate
- **Define extraction schemas** - Type-safe data collection
- **Configure initial state** - Set up proper entry point
- **Use skipIf for known data** - Avoid redundant questions
- **Scope domains** - Limit tool access per route
- **Add route-specific guidelines** - Context-aware behavior
- **Use steps for linear flows** - Cleaner code for simple paths

### ‚ùå Don'ts

- **Don't use vague conditions** - Be specific about when to activate
- **Don't skip extraction schemas** - Loses type safety
- **Don't create overly complex routes** - Split into multiple routes
- **Don't forget requiredData** - Prevent states from executing too early
- **Don't mix concerns** - One route = one goal
- **Don't hardcode state IDs** - Let framework generate deterministic IDs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun 1.0+**
- **Git**
- **TypeScript knowledge**
- Familiarity with AI/LLM concepts (helpful but not required)

### Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/falai.git
cd falai

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/falai-dev/agent.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using bun (recommended)
bun install

# Or using npm
npm install
```

### Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create .env file
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_test_key_here" > .env

# Build the project
bun run build

# Run type checking
bun typecheck

# Run linting
bun lint
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

#### Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/          # Type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Core classes (Agent, Route, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/      # AI provider implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/      # Constants
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Public exports
```

#### Key Principles

- **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself
- **Modular** - Keep code organized and reusable
- **Type-Safe** - Use TypeScript properly
- **Tested** - Add tests for new features
- **Documented** - Update docs for public APIs

### 3. Write Tests

```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test --watch
```

**Test Guidelines:**

- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for features
- Add tests before fixing bugs
- Aim for >80% coverage

### 4. Check Your Code

```bash
# Type checking
bun typecheck

# Linting
bun lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
bun lint:fix

# Build to ensure no errors
bun run build
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for routes"
```

**Commit types:**

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add retry logic to AI provider"
git commit -m "fix: resolve route reference memory leak"
git commit -m "docs: update API reference for Agent class"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify prompt builder logic"
```

### 6. Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface UserContext {
  userId: string;
  userName: string;
}

const agent = new Agent<UserContext>({
  name: "SupportBot",
  provider: provider,
});

// ‚ùå Bad
interface user_context {
  user_id: string;
  user_name: string;
}

const agent = new Agent<any>({
  name: "SupportBot",
  provider: provider,
});
```

### Code Style

- **Use TypeScript** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **camelCase** for variables and functions
- **PascalCase** for classes and interfaces
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants
- **Explicit return types** for public APIs
- **JSDoc comments** for public methods
- **No console.log** in production code (use proper logging)

### File Organization

```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of the file
 */

// Imports - group by: external, internal types, internal code
import { ExternalLib } from "external-lib";
import type { MyType } from "@types/mytype";
import { MyClass } from "@core/MyClass";

// Constants
const DEFAULT_VALUE = 10;

// Types (if not in types/)
interface LocalType {
  // ...
}

// Main code
export class MyClass {
  // ...
}
```

### Documentation Style

````typescript
/**
 * Creates a new agent with the specified configuration.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const agent = new Agent({
 *   name: "MyBot",
 *   provider: provider,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @param options - Configuration options for the agent
 * @returns A new Agent instance
 */
export class Agent<TContext = unknown> {
  constructor(options: AgentOptions<TContext>) {
    // ...
  }
}
````
